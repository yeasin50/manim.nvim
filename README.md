# manim.nvim

A small Neovim plugin to run [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) scenes directly from your editor.  
Pick the class under the cursor and play it in your terminal without leaving Neovim.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Detects the class under your cursor.
- Verifies that `import manim` is present in the file.
- Checks for a valid `manim` executable:
  - Uses system `manim` if available.(didn't test)
  - Falls back to a provided virtual environment (`venv`).
- Sends play command to your terminal (works with [toggleterm.nvim](https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim)).
- Configurable play/export arguments.

> You have to open terminal(toggleterm)for the first time

---

## Compatibility

This plugin has been tested with:

- Manim Community Edition v0.19.0

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
   "yeasin50/manim.nvim",
    cmd = { "ManimCheck", "ManimPlay" },
    ft = "python",
    keys = {
       -- modify  as your will
       -- { "<leader>c", "<cmd>ManimCheck<cr>", desc = "Check Manim availability" },
        { "<leader>m", "<cmd>ManimPlay<cr>",  desc = "Play Manim class" },
    },

    config = function()
        require("manim").setup({
            manim_path = "manim", -- system binary
            venv_path = "/home/...../manim/env", -- optional but if you are just using environment,provide full path
            play_args = { "-pql" }, -- quality/preview args
            export_args = { "-ql" }, -- export args  for future
        })
    end,
}
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. Open a Python file that contains Manim scenes.
2. Make sure it has `import manim` or `from manim import ...` at the top.
3. Place your cursor **inside the class definition** of the scene you want to render.
4. Run one of the commands:

- `:ManimCheck` â†’ verifies that Manim is available (system or venv).
- `:ManimPlay` â†’ sends the render command to your terminal for the class under cursor.

### Example

```python
from manim import *

class Title(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        self.add(Text("Hello from Manim!"))
```

If your cursor is inside Title and you run:

```cmd
:ManimPlay
```

The plugin will send this command to your terminal:

```bash
manim -pql test.py Title
```
